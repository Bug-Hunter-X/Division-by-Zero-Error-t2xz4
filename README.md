This repository demonstrates a common error in C++: division by zero. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to divide an integer by zero.  The `bugSolution.cpp` file provides a corrected version, showcasing how to handle potential division by zero errors.  This example highlights the importance of input validation and error handling to prevent runtime crashes and ensure program stability.
